# University Curriculum Personalization Project

## Overview
This project simulates a university curriculum and student data using graph structures, and recommends personalized course schedules using a heuristic-based strategy aligned with student interests and academic performance.

## Features
- Curriculum modeled as a Directed Graph (NetworkX)
- 100 simulated students with GPA, grades, and interests
- Constraints:
  - Course load: 3–5 courses per term
  - Respect prerequisites
  - Retake policy: failed courses are excluded from eligibility
- Personalized course recommendation engine
- Graph visualization

## Files
- `curriculum_rl_simulation.py`: Main script generating curriculum, students, and recommendations
- `students.json`: Simulated student profiles
- `recommendations.json`: Recommended next-term courses for 10 students
- `cypher_schema.txt`: Neo4j schema for curriculum graph

## Requirements
```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib faker
```

## How to Run
```bash
python curriculum_rl_simulation.py
```
This generates:
- `students.json`
- `recommendations.json`
- Graph visualization of curriculum

## Recommendation Logic
Each student gets 3–5 recommended courses based on:
1. Prerequisite fulfillment
2. Alignment with declared interest (AI, Security, or Data Science)
3. Progress toward graduation (more advanced, in-interest courses ranked higher)

## Notes
- Recommendation uses a heuristic; can be extended to use Reinforcement Learning.
- Course grades range from A to F; GPA is calculated accordingly.
- Only passed courses (grade D or better) are considered for prerequisites.
